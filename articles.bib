  abstract =	 { We consider the following problem: a team of robots
                  is deployed in an unknown environment and it has to
                  collaboratively build a map of the area without a
                  reliable infrastructure for communication. The
                  backbone for modern mapping techniques is pose graph
                  optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the
                  robots, from which the map can be easily built. The
                  first contribution of this paper is a set of
                  distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization:
                  rather than sending all sensor data to a remote
                  sensor fusion server, the robots exchange very
                  partial and noisy information to reach an agreement
                  on the pose graph configuration. Our approach can be
                  considered as a distributed implementation of a
                  two-stage approach that already exists, where we use
                  the Successive Over-Relaxation and the Jacobi
                  Over-Relaxation as workhorses to split the
                  computation among the robots. We also provide
                  conditions under which the proposed distributed
                  protocols converge to the solution of the
                  centralized two-stage approach. As a second
                  contribution, we extend the proposed distributed
                  algorithms to work with the object-based map
                  models. The use of object-based models avoids the
                  exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g. point
                  clouds or RGB-D data) further reducing the
                  communication burden. Our third contribution is an
                  extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed
                  techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo
                  simulations and field experiments in a military test
                  facility. Abundant experimental evidence suggests
                  that one of the proposed algorithms (the Distributed
                  Gauss–Seidel method) has excellent performance. The
                  Distributed Gauss–Seidel method requires minimal
                  information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales
                  well to large teams (we demonstrate mapping with a
                  team of 50 robots), is robust to noise, and is easy
                  to implement. Our field tests show that the combined
                  use of our distributed algorithms and object-based
                  models reduces the communication requirements by
                  several orders of magnitude and enables distributed
                  mapping with large teams of robots in real-world
                  problems. The source code is available for download
